# *Regular Expression Format*:


``Format: Any combination of accepted characters.``<br>




|          String          |           Represents           |
| :----------------------: | :----------------------------: |
|      &alpha;&beta;       |      &alpha; then &beta;       |
|      &alpha;+&beta;      |       &alpha; or &beta;        |
|      &alpha;<sup>*       |      0 or more &alpha;'s       |
| &alpha; ( &rho; ) &beta; | &rho; has priority over &beta; |




>**Note:** The output dictionary will have all transition values, even it they are not represented in the default print table.

<br><br>

***<ins>Accepted Characters:</ins>*** 
>Note: This program will only display the transitions for a, b, and &epsilon; in its default printout table.

This program will accept almost all characters *(See non-accepted characters for exceptions)*.

|           Char           | Represents        |
| :----------------------: | :---------------- |
| a-z, A-Z, 0-9, &epsilon; | Literal Character |
|            +             | Or operation      |
|            *             | Kleene Star       |
|           ( )            | Grouping          |

<br><br>



***<ins>Non-Accepted Characters:</ins>***

Some characters may break the program. Those characters include but are not limited to: 

|   Char   | Represents                            | Will Cause                       |
| :------: | :------------------------------------ | :------------------------------- |
|    \$    | Final Node in <br> return dict        | Unwanted Final Node Declaration  |
|    &     | Epsilon transition in <br>return dict | Unwanted Epsilon Transition      |
|    \t    | End of RE                             | Premature Termination of program |
| &alpha;+ | any string<br> ending with a plus     | Breaking of Program              |






# **How it works**:  

At its core, this program is a simple case of parsing a string, identifying cases, and performing the proper function for each case.

After the program recieves a string in a proper format from the user, The string gets passed to the ``parse()`` function, where an end-tag(``\t``) is appended to the end of the string and then is passed to the ``parseRecur()`` function. 

Once in ``parseRecur()``, the string is first checked if it only contains the terminal character, if yes then terminate. Otherwise the string is broken down into 3 pieces:
* alpha = First character of string
* beta = Rest of string
* nu = Next character following alpha

Now, alpha is checked to see if it is in ```[+,(,),*]```, if its one of these characters, perform the neccessary operation ***(See math section for details of each operation)***. Otherwise, append ```{curpose: {alpha: nextpos} ``` to the final dictionary. return ``parseRecur()`` until the terminating character is found. 

Then return the final dictionary of key-value pairs.
